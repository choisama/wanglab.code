- [x] wangli code repo
\@wangli This repo was created when I was in Dr. Wang, Li's group as a computational biologist to 
help him to construct the analysis platform. These are authentic code used daily to process
the raw data from his Hi-seq Illumina sequencing station.

- [x] yaoyan code repo
\@yaoyan several scripts were implemented to help his colleague, Dr. Yaoyan to handle the miRNA data
from human samples. Her hypothesis was to find the aging candidates correlated with the aging process.
